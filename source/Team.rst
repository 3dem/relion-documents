Takanori studied as an M.D. at Kyoto University, where he also obtained his PhD in Medicine.
In 2014 he also obtained an M.Phil in Computational Biology from the University of Cambridge.
Takanori joined our team in October 2017.
He works on many facets of single-particle analysis and kindly dedicates a lot of his time to provide support to RELION users worldwide.


Sjors Scheres
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=5VgYLcsAAAAJ>`__

Sjors studied Chemistry at Utrecht University, The Netherlands, where he also obtained his PhD in protein crystallography.
He was a post-doc in the group of Jose-Maria Carazo in Madrid, before he started his group at the LMB in 2010.
Sjors designed the *regularised likelihood algorithm* and is the *original architect* of |RELION|.



Past members

Alister Burt
^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=ERGSZbUAAAAJ>`__

Alister studied Chemistry at the University at York, UK and did his PhD at the IBS in Grenoble, France. He was a post-doc in the group of David Barford, where he contributed code to the new sub-tomogram avaraging pipeline in |RELION|-5;


David Li
^^^^^^^^

`Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AGKZlfsAAAAJ>`__

David studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. He worked in the lab of Prof Feng Zhang on CRISPR systems. David joined our group as an MPhil student in October 2022 to work on in vitro assembly of tau filaments. During his stay with us David also developed new classification software for filaments. David went on to do a PhD at Stanford.


Liyi Dong
^^^^^^^^^

Liyi studied Biology at China Agricultural University and did a BSc at Purdue University with Michael Rossmann.
Liyi joined our group as a PhD student in November 2017.
She worked on *automated selection of 2D class averages*.

Shaoda He
^^^^^^^^^

Shaoda studied Biology at Peking University, where he also participated in a programme organized by the Electronic Engineering and Computer Science Department.
Shaoda joined our group in October 2014.
He developed *helical reconstruction* and *local symmetry averaging*.

Joaquín Otón
^^^^^^^^^^^^
