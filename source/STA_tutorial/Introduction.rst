Introduction
============

This tutorial will walk you through the tomography and sub-tomogram averaging pipeline of |RELION|-5.0 . 
This semi-automated pipeline is designed to carry out all of the steps in a typical subtomogram averaging project from your raw tilt series movies to your final subtomogram average. 
We will use a test data set composed of 5 tomograms of immature HIV-1 dMACANC VLPs, which is available at `EMPIAR-10164 <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-10164/>`_.

Requirements
------------

   1. Your raw tilt series data as individual movies, or as individual motion-corrected images, but not as combined tilt series stacks. 
   2. The mdoc files containing the metadata for each tilt series.

Getting Organised
-----------------
We recommend creating a single directory per project. Weâ€™ll call this the project directory. 

To start processing, make your own project directory and download the raw data (frames and mdoc files) corresponding to the five tomograms (``TS_01``, ``TS_03``, ``TS_43``, ``TS_45``, ``TS_54``) from the EMPIAR link above. 
A RELION project directory containing precalculated results of all the processing steps of this dataset can be downloaded from:

   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11068319

We will start by launching the |RELION| GUI.
**It is important to always launch the RELION graphical user-interface (GUI) from the project directory**. 
To prevent errors with this, the GUI will ask for confirmation the first time you launch it in a new directory.
Make sure you are inside the project directory, and launch the GUI by typing:

::

    relion --tomo&

and answer ``Yes`` when prompted to set up a new |RELION| project here.
