High-resolution 3D refinement
=============================

Once we have obtained a refined map in high binning factor (low resolution) we can proceed to refine this dataset to higher resolution.

At this point in the tutorial, the 3D refinement could be directly processed using the original pixel size (binning factor 1).
However, it's recommended to sequentially process 3D refinements through decreasing binning factors to speed up calculations as we don't longer need to setup a large valued low-pass filter for the initial reference.
This initial low-pass filter prevents bias towards high-frequency components in the map and maintains the `gold-standard` of completely independent refinements at resolutions higher than the initial one.
To overcome this, halfmap files can be used as reference maps for each halfset processed by `relion_refine`, keeping the 3D refinement of both halfsets independent along the whole workflow.
To that end, when the reference map filename contains either ``*half?*.mrc`` template, each halfmap is automatically assigned to its halfset.

Pseudo-subtomograms and reference map at bin 1
----------------------------------------------

The order to process :jobtype:`Make pseudo-subtomos` and :jobtype:`Tomo reconstruct particle` jobtypes is irrelevant as long as they are done consecutively to keep track in the |optimisation_set| file.
For 3D refinement at binning factor 1, make sure the following options are properly set on :jobtype:`Make pseudo-subtomos` :guitab:`Reconstruct` tab and :jobtype:`Tomo reconstruct particle` :guitab:`Average` tab:

:Box size (pix):: 512
:Cropped box size (pix):: 192
:Binning factor:: 1

We could also set the solvent mask in the :jobtype:`Tomo reconstruct particle` case to estimate current resolution:

:FSC Solvent mask:: masks/mask_fsc.mrc


.. _sec_sta_refine3d_refinebin1:

Running the auto-refine job at bin 1
-------------------------------------

On the :guitab:`I/O` tab of the :jobtype:`3D auto-refine` job-type set:

:Input optimisation set:: ReconstructParticleTomo/job018/optimisation_set.star

:Reference mask (optional):: masks/mask_align.mrc

On the :guitab:`Reference` tab, set:

:Ref. map is on absolute greyscale?: Yes

:Initial low-pass filter (A): 5.5

     (We set the low-pass filter slightly below the reached resolution in the previous step. In this case, it's Nyquist resolution at binning factor 2.)

:Symmetry: C6

On the :guitab:`CTF` tab set:

:Do CTF correction?: Yes

:Ignore CTFs until first peak?: No

On the :guitab:`Optimisation` tab set:

:Mask diameter (A):: 230

:Mask individual particles with zeros?: Yes

:Use solvent-flattened FSCs?: Yes

On the :guitab:`Auto-sampling` tab set:

:Initial angular sampling:: 1.8 degrees

In our system, using 4 GPU cards, it took around half a day to finish.

Thereafter, running a :jobtype:`Post-processing` job with the tight mask ``masks/mask_fsc.com`` you should obtain a resolution around 3.6Ã…. At this moment, this is the best alignment we could reach without applying any specific tomo refinement, as shown in :ref:`sec_sta_ctfrefine` and :ref:`sec_sta_framealign` sections.

**[TODO: Integrate the below paragraph into this page]**

Before this, since the refined map we obtained in this initial 3D refinement covers the HIV capsid and matrix, we need to make sure the mask we will be using in the next refinement is aligned and focused on the capsid only.
We suggest to recenter the reference as masks provided in ``masks/`` folder are already centered.
You could look at the output refined map (``Refine3D/job009/run_class001.mrc``) and mask (``masks/mask_align_bin4.mrc``) with a 3D viewer like IMOD :textsc:`3dmod` to estimate the Z offset between both maps, in pixels. In our case, it is 2.75 pixels but this could be different as it depends on the initial *de novo* model. Thus, recentering the particles can be done from the command-line:

::

    relion_star_handler --i Refine3D/job009/run_data.star \
    --o Refine3D/job009/run_data_z2.75.star --center --center_Z 2.75


To assess the capsid within the reference map is aligned with the mask, we could reconstruct it using the :jobtype:`Tomo reconstruct particle` job-type, described in the next step :ref:`reconstruct particle <sec_sta_reconstructpart>`.
